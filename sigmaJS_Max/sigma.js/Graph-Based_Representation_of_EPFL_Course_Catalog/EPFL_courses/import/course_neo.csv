This course will focus on two major topics related to development: humanitarianism and public health. By humanitarianism, we refer to benevolent deeds undertaken beyond national frontiers on behalf of individuals, communities, groups or entire nations in dire straits by a variety of actors (i.e. organizations governmental and non-governmental associations, philanthropic foundations). The course will focus on humanitarian and public health’s actors (non governmental organizations such as Médecins sans Frontière; international organizations; philanthropic organizations, for example the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). We will invite some of these actors and visit some of these institutions. We will also study these actors’ tools, such as photography, movie, mass campaign vaccinations. We will pay attention to conflict and post conflict, imperial/colonial and post-colonial periods, during which development became a politically, economically, and socially relevant international issue. The course draws attention to the importance of historical perspectives, showing that global health or humanitarian operations are not inventions of the post-Cold War period but have a longer history. Our aim is to show continuities and ruptures between then and now. Case studies will be favoured in this class. The emphasis will also be put on extra-European countries.

","Social and Cognitive Factors in Professional Learning General Aim: To enable participants to understand the ways in which professionals learn their profession, in the initial training stage, the induction into practice stage and the continuing professional development stage. General Description of Material:The ability for individuals and organisations to learn is often regarded as central to their survival and success in the contemporary world.  But how do professionals (like teachers, or engineers) learn their profession?  What are the differences between how we learn (a) in initial training, (b) during the transition into work and (c) when an experienced professional? Learning is partially a psychological concept, but professionals operate in social contexts and so an understanding of professional learning also draws on sociological research. Therefore understanding professional learning will involve a multi-disciplinary approach. Plan of the course:Through exploring a number of types of studies on different aspects of learning, participants will build an understanding of some different research approaches which are used in studying learning. Students will also participate in studies and experiments to give them concrete experiences both of research approaches and of adult learning in practice.","Learning, Education, Social and Behavioural Science Research, Interdisciplinary Studies"

The approach will be based on a blend of theory and history, contemporary issues and examples borrowed from the past. The course will question the technological as well as epistemological foundations of the modern notion of structure. It will explore the various issues at stake in the diffusion of new materials in architecture. It will also pay a close attention to the way technology exerts an influence on the very definition of the architectural discipline. A series of fundamental evolutions will serve as the background of the lectures. For instance, the increasing tension between architecture and engineering throughout the 19th and 20th centuries will be repeatedly scrutinized. It will be argued that during the same period of time this tension has constituted a permanent source of architectural and technological innovation. The rise of the modern notion of structure will appear as another major thread. Its study will enable to grasp the full scope of its very recent demise in relation with the so-called return of ornament. Of special interest will be also the way static approaches to architectural objects are being constantly challenged by modes of thinking giving precedence to dynamic processes.   Program: Towards a Cultural History of Construction: Introduction.

31,AR-302(a),Studio BA6 (Viganò),"The design studio continues the exploration of the possibility to conceive the city, the territorial and urban space, as a renewable resource. The research concerns the tools, conceptual and operational, to design it coherently.","We need an open perspective on the design of cities and territories. Space is back again at the centre of our preoccupations: as a support which defines conditions, which asks to renew the practice of the urban and territorial project, in between urban design, landscape urbanism, regional and environmental planning. In the common field of the city-territory a new approach must be imagined, starting from individual and collective practices, natural dynamics, rationalization processes. The Alps are a special context in Europe where to study the relation between artificial and natural rationalities. Climate change acts inside this context as a stressor and as a connector. The Alps are crucial in the European space; their modifications can affect territories wider than the Alps themselves. Following the main rivers from the alpine sources to the sea, connecting the upstream territory with the plain downstream can construct an ideal section through the European territory. Strategies of mitigation and adaptation to climate change can be the starting point to re-contextualise the Alps inside Europe and for designing innovative habitat. These are the tasks of the studio. New life-cycles will open up in the Alpine territory in relation to climate change: from the big hydraulic infrastructural works to face the flooding risk till the dismantling ski-resorts. In both cases the embodied energy in the territory is to be investigated and considered as “spatial capital” to be recycled in a new cycle, inside new social geographies. Urban and territorial prototypes will be elaborated to give a concrete spatial configuration to these changes.","City-territory, resource, life-cycles, embodied energy, inclusion "

The open space plays a structural role and is considered as a major resource of the liveable city. Among the case studies: the American territorial grid, Broadacre City; Stadtlandschaft; No-stop city; the city as an archipelago; the projects for Grand Paris (2009). THU II will also address the role of gardens and parks as a field of innovation and experience for urbanism. Students will practice drawing as a theoretical tool.

Following both alternatively, we will examine several issues relating to human's use of nature: economic development, right of undeveloped countries to catch developed ones, of the protection of nature, of the right to natural resources usage, of the right of future generations. Conversely, we will ask too whether humans have duties towards nature; and if yes, on what ground and of what type. Besides, environment is also the one built up by man, in particular the urban one. Should ethical norms orient its planning; and if yes, what ones following which principles. Our general concern will be to identify what makes it so difficult to protect the environment in our society and what could make it more feasible.

Design, painting, photography, modelling and graphics are essential to the architectural project and become didactic instruments for the development of individual talent.","Compounds - words and images  Perception, inspiration and imagination serve as essential cornerstones and starting points in every creative activity in design and architecture. Creativity does not simply flow from nothingness; rather, it needs an archive – be that the mind or a sketch book – from where it draws inspiration, re-arranges and composes. Architects, in their quest for a design, undoubtedly turn first and foremost to the graphic form:  fragments, images or set pieces therefrom, seen or internalized, which are then arranged into novel relationships. These design components consist for the most part of graphic signs that refer to and/or reflect reality linguistically, either in an apparently real or in an abstract way. But these graphic components originate mostly in our visual environment. The topic of the current course builds on the insight that language and its syntax may also serve as an approach to creative design.  The course’s starting point, borrowed from linguistics, is the possibility of combining individual words into a new compound word, the meaning of which may differ from the meaning of each of its parts. This type of word formation, called compounding, is a salient feature in particular of the German language. The number of possible word combinations, especially of noun compounds, is sheer endless. The English language, to a lesser extent, also allows this type of word formation. Thus it will be used an experimental approach to design. At the start of the course, the participants make up a series of compound nouns that do not correspond to any existing reality and have no fixed denotation (for example stair + bed > stair-bed; sleep + door > sleep-door). Next, these fictitious linguistic coinages are to be visually encapsulated and translated into seemingly real architectural objects, using the professional digital image techniques taught during the course.","Idea and representation, the real and the imaginary, the object and its image, architectural expression, figurative digital tools, digital image techniques, photography, image montage, rendering."

209,MATH-459,Numerical methods for conservation laws,"Introduction to the development, analysis, and application of computational methods for solving conservation laws with an emphasis on finite volume, high-order essentially non-oscillatory schemes, and discontinuous Galerkin methods.","The modeling of many problems in the applied sciences and engineering is based on concepts of conservation of mass, momentum and energy, leading to systems of conservation laws. Prominent examples are the Maxwell equations of electromagnetics, the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and equations of elasticity and the systems of magnetohydrodynamics of plasma physics. In this course we shall develop, analysis and apply computational methods suitable for solving systems of conservation laws. We begin by discussing fundamental properties of conservation laws, including their ability to general non-smooth solutions - shocks - from smooth initial conditions, leading to the introduction of weak solutions and entropy conditions. We initiate the discussion of computational methods by finite difference methods for conservation laws and introduce the concept of monotone schemes and the consequences of this. This is followed by a thorough discussion of finite volume methods, including Godunov's methods, monotone fluxes, accuracy and stability of such methods.  We then begin the discussion of methods of higher order accuracy, first by understanding why higher order accuracy is of interest. This sets the stage for the introduction of essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) and weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methods and their fundamental properties. Higher order in time is achieved through the development of strongly stable Runge-Kutta methods (SSP-RK). As a final extension to problems suitable for general geometries, we finally develop discontinuous Galerkin methods as a very general and robust high-order accurate extension of finite volume methods. We study these methods in somedetail, including their mathematical properties and efficient implementation techniques. Throughout the course there will be an emphasis on mastering mathematical as well as computational aspects of the material.","Conservation laws, finite volume methods, ENO/WENO methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods"

218,HUM-340,History of economic thought,"This lecture gives an overview of the history of economic thought. On a thematic issue, it goes further by reading and analyzing primary sources directly, thus giving a practical introduction to various methodologies in the history of economic thought.","In European policy circles, the role of social economy is often reduced to securing social cohesion. Far from being considered as a distinct sector, social economy is limited to employment policies. In this perspective, social economy is supposed to succeed when both the market and the State have failed. However, économie sociale et solidaire (ESS) has an historical connection with the 19th century answer to the « social question ». In France, theoreticians often refer to Proudhon or Walras in order to establish theoretical legitimacy for their work. In the 90s a new type of entrepreneurship emerged in Europe claiming a filiation to social and solidarity economy. At the European level, a group of researchers has been recently formed (EMES) to analyze the emergence of this new network that promotes the combination of economic and social production of goods and services following various criteria: democratic governance, autonomy from the State, diversity of resources. We will highlight this kind of social entrepreneurship, aiming to avoid possible confusions with other ideological approaches of social entrepreneurship. A sound exposition of historical foundations of social economy is required to understand the issues at stake. Hence, we present them in the first part of our course. In the second part of the course, we also raise questions about the representations of society that actors promote in their practice of social economy. Indeed, an action can be evaluated by its consequences, or by analyzing the previous intention that led to it. Taking into account this difference, we try to identify the representations of the so-called social entrepreneurships. Their definition also depends on the country they belong to. In Europe or in the United States, ESS is linked to democracy or philanthropy at different levels. Therefore, it is important to present the criteria used to qualify social entrepreneurship and the cultural ethic it refers to.  In this course, special attention will be paid to the democratic governance of ESS organizations. Some of the criteria for social enterprises are reflected in the European legislation on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental standards, for which social enterprises are an appropriate example that could influence traditional organisations. Indeed, there is a link between social economy and sustainable development. Thus, we also address in the third and last part of the course the question of the fairness of wages in ESS; the different level of solidarity implied; and the financial aspects of these specific organizations that are some times confused with micro-credit enterprises. Three different specialists of the topics are invited to illustrate each of the three themes defined above. Both concrete examples and theoretical analyses are given together. We want to make students understand the link between actors' practices and the theoretical corpus of the social and solidarity economy that still challenges standard economic theory.","Economics, social economy, économie social et solidaire, sustainable development, ethics, history of economic thought, democratic governance"

293,AR-402(c),Studio MA2 (Geers),"The Commons - part 2 will tackle the urgent issue of rebuilding the shared infrastructure of the European territory, with the periphery of Milan as its case-study.","After a full year of research into Metropolitan Architecture, this time Architecture without Content will tacklethe Commons. In the wake of Brexit and the current soul searching inside the European continent about both the amplitude of its territory and the essence of its shared culture, this issue appears even more urgent than ever. Of all possible cases we decided to focus our attention this year on Italy, because exactly there for a certain period of time  public architecture has been a constitutional part of its civilization; i.e. the Roman machine. During a few centuries the standard urban infrastructure of any given Roman city (the theatre, the market, the agora, the baths, the temples, the basilica, the markets, the schools, the legion’s headquarters and so forth) was in fact the essential spine of public life. This architecture thus allowed the very existence of the cities the way we got to know them. Since then, the Commons experienced ups and downs, were boosted by the pride of the city bourgeois in the Gothic cities, and were even carefully planned by the newly developed modern states. In the last century, both the totalitarian state and the welfare state, used the Commons to fulfill their own particular agenda thus producing the final incarnation of the Commons as a solid architectural apparatus for the cities. Since the eighties however, post Thatcher politics (i.e. the Empire) has been eroding the Commons. Today,the Commons we have left in our western society has a heavily transformed profile. In certain nations, as Italy, the phenomenon was particularly evident, as the investments on welfare had been drastically cut. No more social housing, no more schools, no more post offices, no more civic centers: the desert. In the far depths of the Even Covered Field, the suburban mall surreptitiously replaced some of the functions, as such becoming the only possible stage for twisted remnants of anything public.  The reoccuring crisis of the current world-order asks urgently for a way out. Can architecture - common expression of power - enable such a rupture, or at least bring a contribution towards another equilibrium? We believe a possibility lays (again) in the formalization of the Commons. This year we want to investigate if the Commons can still be made and how they can be effective again. We will design where the problem is more evident, in the endless extension of the Roman periphery, a nasty by-product of failed utopias and criminal real estate investments, and in the northern periphery of Milan where the planned city morphs into the informal accumulation of wildly individual choices. In Rome, during first semester, we will unfold a possible narrative following the lines of the Appia, a remarkable axis radiating from the city centre and pointing towards what is left of the Roman countryside. In the second semester we hope to repeate this 'trick' in Milan, using the Northern axis of Corso Sempione.  In the tradition of the Modern, we will locate and design schools, post offices, civic centers, police stations and more, expecting to be surprised by the students even at the level of the program. Success is not guaranteed, but the stakes are too high to be ignored.     ","Form, difficult whole, the even covering of the field, Roman Architecture, Metropolitan Architecture,  condensed urbanity, territory, technological optimism, public architecture, the commons.  "

That house in two different contexts. A house twice.,"CUT CON­STRUCT CONCEIVE   As studio architecten de vylder vinck taillieu always deals with the idea of the reference - what is your frame of reference - but also the idea of the prac­tice - on one hand working on many different projects at the same time on the other hand starting from the detail immediately -; the studio is not only looking for a possible architecture regarding a simulated exercise but rather a possible architect in a studio simulating a practice. Observation - rather than analyze - and imagination - rather than concept - are part of this ap­proach. A strong belief in the variety of media - from handmade drawing to crafted modeling not only as a result rather as an ongoing method - are the instruments on the table. An intense way of working - as an intense way of life – is the credo.   Studio architecten de vylder vinck taillieu announces studio CUT CON­STRUCT CONCEIVE. Cut out’s from drawings and pictures are the starting point. Drawings of never realized houses will be the starting point for the exercises. As the previous studio - school year 2014-2015 - called CORNER CASCADE COMPLEXITY starts from the corner detail to find back in the final project all materiality not as an additive but as a fundament of the space; and the studio NEVER EVER YOURS – school year 2015-2016 - aimed the same idea starting from drawings and models of never realized projects; the difference in this studio - school year 2016-2017 - as it is called CUT CON­STRUCT CONCEIVE is the imagination since it is about cut out’s it is even more challenging.

Since a few decades, this representation is changing. Psychologists, neuroscientists and philosophers consider the body as playing a central role in cognition.

Affects, as corporeal determinants, are now considered as playing a key role in decision making and the way behaviors are adapted to the surrounding, be it physical or social. From this embodied conception of the subject, this course will reconsider the psychological subject and what fund his sense of self.

The free, forced and harmonic motion of a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator is analysed and the corresponding complex, operational and time admittance, as well as the complex response function, are extracted from the system. The two-degree-of-freedom oscillator is then studied and the coupling between the two degrees of freedom is carefully investigated. The study is generalised to the analysis of the multi-degree-of-freedom oscillator under conservative or dissipative (proportional and general viscous damping), free or forced, motion. In a second part, the course is oriented towards the vibratory behaviour of second-order continuous systems like cables under transverse vibrations, bars under longitudinal vibrations or shafts under torsional vibrations. The analysis is then extended to fourth-order continuous systems such as beams subjected to bending vibrations. Finally, the course gives a brief overview of the elementary non-linear oscillator by investigating the different sources of non-linearity, by describing the free and forced motion of the non-linear system and by discussing some solution methods of time and frequency integration.","Oscillator, Vibrations, Dynamics, Modal Analysis"

It is therefore, by definition, a highly multidisciplinary field that spans both the inorganic and the organic world. The phenomenon of biomineralization is relevant to the Earth, Environmental and Life Sciences on practically all length scales. From the immense scale of reef-systems and global ocean life-cycles to small bacterial communities, the impact of biominera­liza­tion spans length scales of at least 12 orders of magnitude and a large fraction of geological time! But despite the global environmental impact of biomineralization and its funda­mental scien­ti­fic importance, there are still many open questions about the basic biological mecha­nisms involved. This class aims at giving the student an insight into the study of fundamental biological processes that shape biominerals and determine their chemical and isotopic composition. The physiology of biomineralization, matrix-mediated control of biominerals, cell-environment interface will be discussed for a number of organisms, including bacteria, corals, foraminifera and sponges.

Today this city-territory, a “Horizontal Metropolis”, works as a spatial capital and as an agent of transformation, as a support and a place of potentiality. It is a layered territorial construction where agriculture and non-agriculture economic activities create an original mix. The HM is a natural capital as well as a spatial capital. This specific spatial condition has been the test case for the elaboration of original urban theories and is facing today new challenges, paradoxes and crises. It can also be, today, the support of an innovative urban and territorial project. Contemporary urban figures as Città diffusa in Northern Italy, Desakota in Asia, fine grain settlement dispersion in Flanders, or Zwischenstadt in Germany are just some of the examples able to effectively describe the emergence of acompletely new urban condition, increasingly related to the dispersion of the urban fabric in the agricultural landscape. The Horizontal Metropolis concept considers these figures beyond the center/periphery opposition revealing the dispersed contemporary condition as an asset - not a limit - for the construction of a sustainable and innovative urban dimension where horizontality of infrastructure, urbanity and relationships, mixed use and diffuse accessibility generate a specific habitable space. The radical nature of the change underway, together with the emergence of new urban paradigms, call today for a radical rethinking of the Western Metropolis idea and form. The Horizontal Metropolis concept represents an ambitious attempt to take on this challenge, at the global scale. Superstudio will investigate the Horizontal Metropolis, its space, its tradition, formation and authors; its relevance today as an energetic, ecological and social design issue.  ","City-territory, Desakota, Città Diffusa, Rurbanisation, Zwischenstadt, Horizontality.  "

To write the music thus consisted in noting only a part of the contents of a work. Thus, an ephemeral and invisible world could evolve between the lines. The characteristics of this world are described in certain theoretical works and are reflected in testimonies written by musicians and travellers. Several attitudes can be shown, for example, the complete improvisation of a work, the improvisation on a bass line or an existing theme or the improvisation by adding melodic figures and ornaments to written music. The art of improvising touched all the categories of instruments (wind, strings, keyboard) as well as the voice. It was also an art which proposed a meeting between popular music and learned music, a dialogue bursting between two musical universes.

At the same time, social practices are symptomatic of a decreasing interest in the car: lower vehicle sales, decline in the percentage of young people who pass their driving license, etc. The reasons lie not only in a decrease in the purchasing power of individuals and greater value attributed to other consumer goods, but also in changing lifestyles.   Our Teaching Unit will explore the future of urban space on the assumption that the trends outlined here could accelerate, culminating in the total elimination of the car. This radical hypothesis prompts us to reverse our perspective upon urban space. What would happen in a post-car world (http://postcarworld.epfl.ch) to the vast amount of territory now dedicated to traffic and to cars? What potential reuse will be made of countless square meters of roads and cubic meters of building that would otherwise be under-utilized, if not merely abandoned? What about the forms of territory that have been shaped by the century of the car? What about a new urban mobility that would combine short distance (walking, cycling) and commuter mobility? What new forms and dimensions of public space, what uses and atmospheres?   The case study site chosen to address these questions is a segment of the north-east shore of Lake Geneva between the two agglomerations of Geneva and Lausanne-Morges, an area whose economic vitality depends on its attractiveness in terms of quality of life and job opportunities. If automobile traffic was a decisive factor for its development, it is now an obstacle, given the counterproductive effects of downturns and daily traffic jams. Will the city territory Leman, its character and qualities, be perpetuated beyond the terms established by individual motorized traffic?   In order to make a proper territorial inversion, students will sketch a project in two stages: in reference to the concept of Porosity, they will re-articulate networks of mobility on a portion of land 70 km long; afterwards, they will test the possibilities for reuse of car space at the scale of Proximity.  ",urbanism - urban planning - city - territory - landscape - density.

Urban planning involves important decisions that have an impact on sustainable development. The consumption of non-renewable energy resources within buildings is influenced by the availability of natural resources, which in turn depend on the proximity of other buildings. Synergies can be obtained between them (heat expelled by a building can be used as an  energy source by another) and between resources (heat and power can be generated from wastes). Urban planning also affects the habitat and the organization of public transportation and traffic within neighbourhoods and outwards. Economies of scale improve the sustainability of renewable energies as well as energy efficient technologies (cogeneration). The present ENAC Learning Unit aims to introduce these novel concepts in sustainable planning as well as their implementation in neighbourhoods. A new computer-modelling tool (CitySim) will also be used in this framework.

The contents are organized as follows:  Introduction to various requirements in terms of indoor comfort to be guaranteed within buildings, and their assessment: thermal comfort, air quality and ventilation, visual comfort, etc. Relevant norms and regulations are discussed as well as the state of the art in defining these different comfort aspects to support and contextualize the proposed reflexion. For each type of comfort, the architectural measures (in terms of geometry and materials, typically) capable to fully or partially ensure comfort are introduced as priority measures for architects to work with. Their description and analysis is performed through specific case studies. The sustainable systems or technologies available today to complement comfort where passive means are insufficient are presented in detail. The constraints regarding their integration to the architectual design process are analyzed and the available integration solutions are discussed. The theoretical contents are complemented by an introduction to several simulation tools appropriate for the quantitative assessment of the energy and comfort performance of a project.  The students, working in teams, will resort to the provided information to bring a critical perspective on the realization of these objectives within a real context through the analysis of an existing building that will be compared to an idealized situation (reference), for which examples taken from the Solar Decathlon competition will be used.

They do so following both complex and often cryptic patterns. Within the process of creating both standardized and automatic flows and treatment of information, Internet so increases the individuals' capacities of exchange, of organisation, of production - in spite of the topographic distances that may separate them. Launched five decades ago, such a process has extended its magnitude during the last ten years, to the extent of disrupting the various elements structuring our being together - such as norms, ethics, practices and governance - underlining the fragility relative to the latter's only temporarily stable, and so often debated, legitimacy. A full appreciation of the corresponding stakes requires an appropriate and renewed understanding of social facts at large (reorganisation of the various forms of intermediation, increased exposure of one's personal life, frailty of the digital identity, reconsideration of immaterial goods' market value).

This textbook is an excellent introduction to the field of Solid Waste Engineering and gives insight into relevant solid waste treatment technologies and practices. ,"With the third edition of Solid Waste Engineering, the authors have decided to expand this college textbook to focus on the worldwide problem of solid waste management. This change is illustrated by the addition of “A Global Perspective” to the title. Given that we are currently using our natural resources at an unsustainable rate, polluting our ocean and land with a variety of waste products and altering our atmosphere with gases that are causing further global warming, now is the time to educate future engineers with knowledge and tools to address these worldwide problems. The course is following the logic structure and the chapters of the book. The third edition has been rearranged to follow the hierarchy of solid waste management, reduce, reuse, recycle and recovery. Thus students will first learn about integrated waste management strategies, an expertise which will support the future engineer to take measures for pollution prevention as well as for resources conservation. In chapter 2 the students are introduced to municipal solid waste characteristics, including the identification of different waste components and materials. Component specific information is needed for recovery, separation and recycling of waste materials. The relevance of chemical, physical and mechanical properties are discussed in more detail as a basis for the chapters which follow. These properties are most helpful in order to identify potentially meaningful recycling pathways, as well as to decide about possible technological separation and purification options. The next chapter is dedicated to the collection of municipal solid waste, a key, but many times overlooked, component of integrated waste management. Following collection is mechanical processing, in most cases the necessary first step to the recycling and recovery of municipal solid waste. The students will then study mechanical, biological, and thermal processes. For each of these topics the authors have dedicated a separate chapter which will introduce the students to the basic principles of these separate disciplines in the context of waste management. Since not all waste streams can be recovered, students move on to residue management by combustion and landfilling. Finally students are exposed to the current issues in solid waste management and the principles of integrated and sustainable solid waste management. In a few cases the lectures at EPFL and the home reading will be complemented with field visits to waste treatment facilities.","Waste Technologies, Recycling, Recovery, Secondary Resources, Mechanical Treatment, Thermal Treatment, Co-treatment, Landfilling, Residues, Stabilization, Heavy Metals, Biomass, Bioenergy, Technical Ordinance on Waste, Material and Elemental Flow Analysis"

922,AR-301(b),Studio BA5 (Graf F.),Work to be done on existing structures is a major stake in the development of the city of the 21st century. The protection project and the project to be pursued in existing structures are part of a composite cultural discipline that extends the borders of contemporary architecture.,"Building in built structures is not a new practice, far from it. What turns it into a contemporary attitude, however, is the kind of theoretical and practical questioning about the architectural object at all its scales, as well as a closer look at the material character of the building, which both give rise to the project.   The protection project calls for a number of rational and technical investigations which will at once yield knowledge of the object of the study and define the uses of potential work to be carried out. The documentation of the building will be compiled with the help of historical research and graphic and photographic records, of its construction process and its material character, and of its sensitive and sensual aspects. The heritage value of the building will be determined by placing it in its historical, architectural and urban context, in the work of the actors that designed and built it, as well as in terms of its role as an economic and social resource. An analysis of its functional and distribution capacities, of its constitution and physical characteristics will dictate its potentials in terms of utilisation, maintenance and restructuring.The protection project is a dual and inseparable project of conservation and renovation: the material substance of an existing building is conserved, preserved, reinforced, set off to advantage or returned to its original function, while at the same time something new is grafted onto this building to produce a prolongation of its life-cycle, a superimposition and juxtaposition of added elements. The project also concerns the reinforcement of a metal frame as well as the addition of a new functional body, and it focuses on the awareness of the relations and interfaces produced by their significance.The workshop thus aims to familiarise students with the theoretical and practical elements of the development of the discipline of this project: of this knowledge in action.The object - and indeed the entirety - of this study and the subject of the project is linked to our daily heritage: that of the towns and countryside of post-war French-speaking Switzerland.","Language en                                                  NaN fr    Sauvegarde, architecture moderne et contempora...

He learns to apply the finite element method to simple test cases and to more complex problems faced in practice","Starting from the strong form associated to the problem of the longitudinal deformation in a uniform bar under traction and compression, the corresponding integral formulation and the weak form are first developed. The latter formulation is next discretised by means of the Galerkin method and the finite element method. Typical concepts like shape functions, classes of admissible functions, Hilbert and Sobolev spaces of functions or convergence criteria, necessary for the understanding of the approach, are briefly described, and the discrimination between natural and essential boundary conditions is discussed. The one-dimensional problem is then generalised by introducing various discontinuities (loading, section, material, etc) into the bar and the concept of higher-order finite elements is introduced. Following an approach similar to the one used for the one-dimensional problem, the course then focuses on the two-dimensional boundary-value problem of heat conduction on a surface. The corresponding weak formulation based on a scalar variable (temperature) is then approximated with two-dimensional finite elements. Lagrangian and serendipity, quadrangular and triangular, so-called master elements are developed and used for elaborating two-dimensional arbitrarily shaped finite elements (geometrically deformed finite elements). After a convergence study of the approximated solutions obtained with two-dimensional finite elements, an example of application is fully treated.","Finite element, Weak Form, Integral Formulation, Numerical Methods"

Therefore, the UE-N focuses on experimenting with artistic techniques for interpreting reality and transmitting ideas.","Speculation & Artifact Perception, inspiration and imagination serve as essential cornerstones and starting points in every creative activity in design and architecture. We are nowadays experiencing profound changes and will be confronted in future with even more fundamental upheavals in the areas of technology, society and ecology. There will be no easy answers or tried and tested solutions to many of the challenges to be faced. Creativity, inventiveness und mental agility will be in high demand especially among the current and future generations of students and trainees. Creativity is nurtured by a mentally agile, playful, sometimes near naive approach. This mental act, not always logical, mostly driven by intuition, is also of paramount importance for our continued existence because – in an environment characterized by rationally operating computers and machines – it is this non-rational and elusive tactic that will offer and secure an irreplaceable place for us humans in future. The module will focus on working with experimental and visual compositional techniques. The main interest lies in the visual connecting and rearranging of what is seemingly incompatible, image constructions that have very little to do with reality, utopia in terms of content, composed however in terms of visual vocabulary mostly as photographs, thus apparently very plausible and realizable. With the 3D and rendering programme Cinema 4D, students will develop a compelling series of images, ranging from abstract two-dimensional image compositions to figurative, fictitious and speculative arrangements of objects. On their computers, and with a series of progressive exercises, participants will develop a series of unconventional image compositions. These, in a first phase, are based on the arrangement of colour, surface and basic body, and in the second phase, the compositions use found components and those drawn from 3D libraries. In this context, work examples from the genres of abstract art, still life and assemblage are used as reference.

This semester: IN FLAGRANTI. ,"The course Magma et Principes tends to improve the transparency between laboratories by providing a platform for discussion and confrontation of various dialectical positions. The purpose of theses exchanges is finally to sketch an image of the architecture through its similarities and differences. The topic of 2015, CLIENTS, will explore the different relationships that architects can have with purchasers. The theme was inspired by an older issue of the magazine rassegna of the 80th where the question was about the pencil of the clients in the work of Le Corbusier. This pencil sometimes opened up a visionary field or was more apunishing restricting instrument in the design process. Today there exists a huge range of varieties of client-architect relationsships from privat order, public, investor, prime contractors, etc.who needs each a very specific way of communication. This tour of Magma & Principes we will discuss this phenomenon of different connections. We will try toanalyse with stunnishing examples, the first contacts, the production process and the stage of the dissociation after the birth of the common result and observe thespatial and expressive influences of the process. The seduction and persuasions acts between the architect and his client is for Magma & Principes a specific issue where we think that between belly, heart and head there is a lot of important surprises to be expected. The contribitions of the professors should help students to develop an inspired and accurate work. Their task is to offer an authentic reflection in the form of concise illustrated text on the theme. The teachers involved in a contribution towards CLIENTS will be Kempe Thil,  Bernard Cache, Vincent Kaufmann, Roberto Gargiani, Yves Weinand, Patrick Aebischer, Giuliani & Hönger, Andrea Bassi, Jacqueline Burkchard, Emmanuel Rey, De Vinck Tailleu and Bakker & Blanc.  Preparing a publication with contributions from teachers and the best students work is planned for the winter semester 2015/2016.

1134,ME-476,Particle-based methods,This course provides an introduction to particle-based methods for the numerical resolution of partial differential equations describing continuum phenomena or for the simulation of particulate flows. Details are given for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and the Discrete Element Method (DEM).,"Particle-based computational methods are being increasingly employed for solving a variety of problems in engineering and applied science. While such Lagrangian methods can yield significant advantages compared to traditional mesh-based methods, their accurate and efficient implementation also provides a number of challenges. This course presents the fundamental aspects of two methods:  Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)  is used to resolve partial differential equations, generally for convection-dominated fluid flows, and is based on the interpolation of field quantities around discrete points that are free to move in space. Discrete Element Method (DEM)  is used for simulating granular and particulate flows and tracks particle motions and detects and models collisions between particles and with their environment.  The course provides an introduction to these two methods and their domains of application (e.g. fluid and solid mechanics, computer graphics). The theoretical basis of each method, including specific aspects such as parallelization and visualization, is presented in introductory lectures. Following a literature search and private study, students give oral presentations on more advanced aspects. Exercises using open-source software and a mini-project provide practical experience in the application of these methods. Illustrations of the use of particle-based methods is also provided by researchers from industry.","Numerical simulation, Fluid and granular flow, Smoothed particle hydrodynamics, Discrete element method"

1137,AR-434,The preservation project: theories and techniques,Construction within existing buildings is nothing new. What gives it contemporary relevance is the type of theoretical and practical questions we have to pose concerning the architectural object and the close-range examination of building fabric that is involved.,"The course has two aims. To begin with, it will trace the evolution of the constructional systems characteristic of 20th-century architecture, dealing with key notions such as new materials, industrialisation of the building sector and how it transformed the process of building, and the artificial control of building services and comfort. This multidisciplinary knowledge calls for both historical research and detailed consideration of materials technology and construction practice as well as economic and environmental aspects. Critical-historical research and material analysis, based on the specific constructional identity of 20th-century architecture, demand ad hoc preservation strategies, developed using specific skills and with a firm grounding in theoretical discourse. Creating design tools - for both theory and practice - that take account of the particular issues surrounding modern heritage conservation is the second major objective of the course. By examining events that had particular importance in shaping the discipline, the theoretical basis for design within existing structures - for monumental architecture and ordinary buildings alike - can be tackled while also addressing operational issues and techniques for conservation-restoration. Throughout the semester students will consider the ideas that evolved during the 19th and 20th centuries that make up the history of preservation theory. This is not simply a matter of deepening one's appreciation of the fundamentals of the discipline but also of stimulating a critical and consistent approach among students in their work to existing buildings.","Material history of buildings, theories of conservation, conservation practice, modern architecture, preservation, restoration, renovation.  "

Understand and analyze the various styles and musical and social contexts in which the concerto evolves. Know the major works belonging to this musical genre and distinguish the various characteristics.,"Music and emotions - An inquiry on the theoretical and practical  tradition of ancient  greek ideas concerning the affective power of music.   The discussion about the causes and the means of the affective power of  ancient Greek music has been the main concern of musical topics for more  than 18 centuries. During the Renaissance, composers and scholars  writing on music increasingly bent their creative efforts toward the  reconstruction of the technical conditions that were supposed to cause  the marvelous effects of music on human soul, producing angry, fear,  melancholy and even madness. Setting secular poetry to music, Nicola  Vicentino, a well-known champion of this goal, wrote that the  composer’s sole obligation is to animate the words and, with harmony,  to represent their passions – now harsh now sweet, now cheerful, now sad  – in accordance with their subject matter.   Nowadays, although no one  questions the importance of the affections in the music of the Baroque  period, musicologists have paid comparatively little attention to the  practical aspect of this topic. Some years ago, a specialist like  Georges Buelow, denied the existence of an Affektenlehre before  the XVIIIth century, and defined it as an invention of the composer  Johann Mattheson. But he was certainly wrong.  An enquiry on the  treatises and music of that period can show the existence of a  substantial body of theory and practice concerning  the emotional  characterization of the elements of musical harmony : intervals, scales  modes, keys, figures and rhythms, not only prior to Mattheson but even  to Descartes,  Mersenne and A. Kircher.   Because these doctrines arise  from a compound of disciplines -theory of proportions, harmonic theory,  galenic theory of humors, verbal rhetoric - the study of this topic  offers a unique opportunity for an interdisciplinary approach of music,  history of science and humanities. Moreover, the practical aspect of  this doctrine represents the best approach of the rhetorical conventions  of musical expression of Renaissance and Baroque music.  ","Harmonic theory, theory of passions, affections, Affektenlehre, émotions and music, Greek music, musical humanism, madrigal.

Its basic hypothesis is that the contribution of our  disciplines to these issues has always been quite significant, that it  deserves more than ever to come again in the foreground, and that we  must therefore revisit the whole jurisprudence and theory of  architecture. The course will therefore articulate two kinds of  cultures. The first one, outside the field of architecture proper, will  mix contributions from environmental history, philosophy, anthropology,  economy and ecology . The other one, more internal, will gather  contributions from designers, but also from historians and theoreticians  of architecture, urban and landscape design. While the first semester  will concentrate on the evolution of the environment and the history of  environmental concerns, the second will focus on the ways in which those  concerns have been formulated and dealt with in the practice and theory  of architecture and landscape design.","Language fr    NaN en    NaN Name: Mot-clef, dtype: object"

Various instruments or groups of instruments guide choreographies. The styles and the practised genres varied according to the sociological and cultural contexts. The characteristics of the music evolved in narrow relationship with the movements and the steps of the dancers. Parallel to that repertory of danced music, evolved an entire musical literature based on the dances but excluding clearly the presence of the dancers (stylized dances). We witnessed the emergence of new musical traditions. One danced and played music in highly varied contexts: to amuse the nobility, in the opera, during ceremonies, etc. On the other hand, the western religious environment could not tolerate this form of expression. Thus, there were designated places, buildings for the performance of danced music and the stylized dance forms of music. This lesson proposes a chronological approach of the various traditions of the music and the dance from the antiquity to present day through the study of iconographic documents and various treatises.

1259,AR-401(c),Studio MA1 (Geers),"The Commons - part 1: Appia Novissima will tackle the urgent issue of rebuilding the shared infrastructure of the European territory, with the Roman periphery as its case-study.","After a full year of research into Metropolitan Architecture, this time Architecture without Content will tackle the Commons. In the wake of Brexit and the current soul searching inside the European continent about both the amplitude of its territory and the essence of its shared culture, this issue appears even more urgent than ever. Of all possible cases we decided to focus our attention this year on Italy, because exactly there for a certain period of time  public architecture has been a constitutional part of its civilization; i.e. the Roman machine. During a few centuries the standard urban infrastructure of any given Roman city (the theatre, the market, the agora, the baths, the temples, the basilica, the markets, the schools, the legion’s headquarters and so forth) was in fact the essential spine of public life. This architecture thus allowed the very existence of the cities the way we got to know them. Since then, the Commons experienced ups and downs, were boosted by the pride of the city bourgeois in the Gothic cities, and were even carefully planned by the newly developed modern states. In the last century, both the totalitarian state and the welfare state, used the Commons to fulfill their own particular agenda thus producing the final incarnation of the Commons as a solid architectural apparatus for the cities. Since the eighties however, post Thatcher politics (i.e. the Empire) has been eroding the Commons. Today, the Commons we have left in our western society has a heavily transformed profile. In certain nations, as Italy, the phenomenon was particularly evident, as the investments on welfare had been drastically cut. No more social housing, no more schools, no more post offices, no more civic centers: the desert. In the far depths of the Even Covered Field, the suburban mall surreptitiously replaced some of the functions, as such becoming the only possible stage for twisted remnants of anything public.  The reoccuring crisis of the current world-order asks urgently for a way out. Can architecture - common expression of power - enable such a rupture, or at least bring a contribution towards another equilibrium? We believe a possibility lays (again) in the formalization of the Commons. This year we want to investigate if the Commons can still be made and how they can be effective again. We will design where the problem is more evident, in the endless extension of the Roman periphery, a nasty by-product of failed utopias and criminal real estate investments, and in the northern periphery of Milan where the planned city morphs into the informal accumulation of wildly individual choices. In Rome, during first semester, we will unfold a possible narrative following the lines of the Appia, a remarkable axis radiating from the city centre and pointing towards what is left of the Roman countryside. In the second semester we hope to repeate this 'trick' in Milan, using the Northern axis of Corso Sempione.  In the tradition of the Modern, we will locate and design schools, post offices, civic centers, police stations and more, expecting to be surprised by the students even at the level of the program. Success is not guaranteed, but the stakes are too high to be ignored.","Form, difficult whole, the even covering of the field, Roman Architecture, Metropolitan Architecture,  condensed urbanity, territory, technological optimism, public architecture, the commons, Via Appia"

1532,AR-365,Environmental Arts and History I,"This course aims at introducing students to the history of landscapes and the environment, and to the ways in which the environmental concerns, which are strongly going to affect the design of cities and architecture, have emerged during the last decades.","By giving an overview of the global environmental history, of the fundamental role played by the management of resources in the evolution of territories, cities and landscapes, and by analysing some of the strategies which architects, urban and landscape designers have developed in the last century, the ambition of this course is to stimulate the environmental conscience and theoretical imagination of students. Its basic hypothesis is that the contribution of our disciplines to these issues has always been quite significant, that it deserves more than ever to come again in the foreground, and that we must therefore revisit the whole jurisprudence and theory of architecture. The course will therefore articulate two kinds of cultures. The first one, outside the field of architecture proper, will mix contributions from environmental history, philosophy, anthropology, economy and ecology . The other one, more internal, will gather contributions from designers, but also from historians and theoreticians of architecture, urban and landscape design. While the first semester will concentrate on the evolution of the environment and the history of environmental concerns, the second will focus on the ways in which those concerns have been formulated and dealt with in the practice and theory of architecture and landscape design.","Environment, landscape, urbanism, ecology, history, art."
